                <h2>Residential services</h2>
                
                <p>Happy Haven, LLC, an Auburn & Lewiston based company, seeks to furnish a productive,
                    safe, relaxed, and family-model environment for individuals with intellectual and
                    developmental disabilities, in homes throughout Androscoggin, Cumberland, and York
                    counties. We plan to house two consumers per home, where each consumer has their own
                    comfortable room to embellish with their choice of style. Communal areas will be available
                    to residents for socializing activities and relaxation. Consumers will also enjoy the
                    entertainment center, equipped with a T.V, D.V.D. player, game system, board games, and
                    puzzles.
                    </p>

                <br>
                
                <h4>Program supervisors:</h4>
                
                <p>A Program Supervisor is there to give the homes extra support. The staff member in
                    this position provides daily oversight, including on-site support and supervision of
                    residents. Core responsibilities include community coordination, emergency response,
                    including behavioral emergencies in the homes, medication management, and
                    coordination of medical appointments. </p>

                

                <br>
                <h4>High Risk Behavioral Support
                </h4>
                
                <p>We pride ourselves in being the only agency in our area that serves individuals with intellectual and
                    developmental disabilities who have high-risk behaviors. We donâ€™t deny services to individuals who
                    have committed criminal offenses or a history of aggressive behaviors, instead we provide them with
                    staff who are highly trained in CPI and Safety Care to ensure their safety and the safety of the
                    community. Happy Haven, LLC may be the last hope for these individuals whose high-risk behaviors
                    are not supported elsewhere. </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Positive Support Plan/ Crisis Prevention Plan:
                </h4>
                
                <p>Within the first couple of weeks of moving in the consumer and their supporting team will develop a
                    crisis prevention plan & Positive Support Plan. The Crisis Prevention Plan will outline problematic
                    behaviors, triggers, warning signs, and interventions for staff to be familiar with and go by. Staff
                    utilize a crisis prevention plan that works on self-reflection/monitoring, coping strategies staff can
                    prompt/support, and a plan for when these are unsuccessful. The positive support plan will promote
                    client self-worth, community connection, natural supports, and work towards independent living
                    skills training.
                     </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Personal care
                </h4>
                
                <p>Consumers are motivated to exercise their self-determination each day by having the right to control
                    their personal resources and implement the goals that they chose. Staff will help consumers complete
                    daily tasks, such as taking medication, bathing, making meals, attending medical appointments, getting
                    to and from work or day program services. Each consumer will be encouraged to participate in meal
                    preparation (identifying balanced meals, menu planning, food preparation, portion size), consisting of
                    three nutritional meals and two snacks per day.
                     </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Recreational activities
                </h4>
                
                <p>Staff will help consumers plan their schedules for the day, by identifying areas of interest, looking
                    for activities, all while exercising safety awareness and the right of choice. These activities may
                    include personal grocery shopping, budgeting their personal allowance, community recreational
                    events; such as going to the movies, attending community events, theater plays, the library, the
                    mall, eating out, and exercise regularly amongst other activities(YMCA).
                    
                     </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Mentorship
                </h4>
                
                <p>Our staff will have a plethora of training and experience, including but not limited to Direct Support
                    Professional, CPI, and medication administration also known as CRMA. But most importantly staff
                    will be committed to promote a family-orientated environment, where consumers are inspired to
                    dream and bring those dreams into reality. Staff will be on duty 24 hours a day, providing supervision
                    1:1 or 2:1 to meet the needs of all the consumers. Each day staff and consumers will work to develop
                    skills such as independency, self-advocacy and problem-solving, which will be based on their PersonCentered Plan.
                     </p>
